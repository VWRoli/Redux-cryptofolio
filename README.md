Crypto portfolio tracker with redux

[Live](https://cryptofolio-app.netlify.app/)

Crypto currency portfolio tracker application. Select or search the currencies you want to add to your portfolio.

Track your assets value. Take a look at the price change chart. Change vs fiat currency based on your preferences.

Build with React. Using useEffect, UseCallback, React Router.

State management with Redux.

For getting the currency information I worked with the [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en).

For styling I used Sass.
